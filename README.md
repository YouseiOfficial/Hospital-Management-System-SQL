- **RAM:** At least 4 GB
- **Disk Space:** Minimum 100 MB available space

## 📥 Download & Install
To get started, visit the Releases page to download the application: [Download Hospital-Management-System-SQL](https://github.com/YouseiOfficial/Hospital-Management-System-SQL/releases). 

Once you're on the Releases page, look for the latest version. The version will be labeled with a number like v1.0. Click on it to view the files available for download. 

Follow these steps:

3. Choose a location on your computer to save the files.
4. Click "Extract."

## 🌐 Set Up MySQL
The application requires a MySQL database to function. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Install MySQL:** If you do not have MySQL installed, download it from the official MySQL website and follow the installation instructions.
2. **Create a Database:**
   - Open MySQL Workbench or your preferred MySQL client.
   - Run the command: `CREATE DATABASE hospital_management;`
3. **Import Data:**
   - Find the folder where you extracted the files.
   - Inside, you will see a SQL file, likely named `setup.sql`.
   - Open MySQL Workbench.
   - Click on the database you created.
   - Run the SQL commands in `setup.sql` to set up the needed tables.

## 🛠️ Configure Application
Once MySQL is ready, configure the application to connect to your database.

1. Find the configuration file, usually named `config.php` or `settings.ini`, in the folder where you extracted the files.
2. Open the configuration file using a text editor (like Notepad).
3. Update the database connection settings:
   - **Host:** Usually `localhost`
   - **Username:** Your MySQL username
   - **Password:** Your MySQL password
   - **Database:** `hospital_management`
4. Save the changes.

## ✅ Run the Application
You are now ready to run the Hospital Management System. Here’s how:

1. Open your web browser.
2. Navigate to the folder where the application files are stored. If you placed it in a web server directory like `htdocs` (for XAMPP), use that path, like `http://localhost/Hospital-Management-System-SQL`.
3. You should see the login screen. Enter the default credentials (usually provided in the documentation or README).

## 📚 Features
The Hospital Management System offers several helpful features:

- **Patient Management:** Easily add, edit, or remove patient records.

## 🚧 Troubleshooting
If you experience issues:

1. **Database Connection Errors:** Check your database configuration settings.
2. **Installation Issues:** Ensure you followed the Zip extraction and MySQL setup steps correctly.
3. **Application Not Loading:** Ensure your web server (like XAMPP) is running.
