## ✅ Run the Application
You are now ready to run the Hospital Management System. Here’s how:

1. Open your web browser.
2. Navigate to the folder where the application files are stored. If you placed it in a web server directory like `htdocs` (for XAMPP), use that path, like `http://localhost/Hospital-Management-System-SQL`.
3. You should see the login screen. Enter the default credentials (usually provided in the documentation or README).
